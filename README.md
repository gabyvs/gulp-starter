GULP STARTER PROJECT
====

This project uses gulp to automate some tasks that are useful for front end development

* Pre-process and minify CSS
* Bundle and minify JavaScript
* Optimize images for the web
* Move minified files to a specific directory
* Automatically lint files for errors
* Automatically run tests
* Automatically reload the browser when files change

Since you cannot always install gulp globally, this one uses local gulp to run all these tasks.
 
## To use it

* Clone this repo 
* Install its dependencies by running `yarn`/`npm install`
* Run `yarn gulp` to run the tasks defined in `gulpfile.js`
